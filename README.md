DES Weak lensing test code
==========================

Collated DES weak lensing null tests.  I can make this private if desired.


Planned tests
-------------

Key tests:
 - Size, shape residual as functions of flux
 - Residual tests as function of WCS shear: binned shear(wcs_shear)
 - Single epoch shape measurements of galaxies in different exposure
 

Deferred tests:
 - Shear-shear correlations
 - Galaxy-Galaxy tests
